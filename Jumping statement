# break statement: The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when it is encountered. It breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop, and the program control resumes at the next statement after the loop.
# continue statement: The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It continues with the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.

# break statement
print("Using break statement:")

    print(i)

# continue statement
print("\nUsing continue statement:")
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue

# Expressions:
An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produces a result. It represents a calculation or a value in a programming language.
Operators:
Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform specific operations on values or variables. There are different types of operators:

Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), etc.
Comparison Operators: Used to compare values, such as equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), etc.
Logical Operators: Used to combine or negate boolean values, such as and, or, and not.

Type Casting:
Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. For example, converting an integer to a float, or a string to an integer. This is often necessary when you need to perform operations or manipulate data of different types.

# Expression
result = 2 + 3  # The expression "2 + 3" evaluates to 5

# Operator
x = 10
y = 5
sum = x + y  # The "+" operator adds x and y together

# Type Casting
num_str = "42"
num_int = int(num_str)  # The int() function converts the string "42" to the integer 42
